# Instruction
run rng.py and select how big list of numbers you want to generate, it will be stored in CSV file.

run sort.py and choose which sorting algorithm to use to sort generated CSV file.


Result will be saved in sorted.csv file
I don't suggest generating numbers bigger than 20,000 if you are using any other algorithm except for Merge sort.
